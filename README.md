## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- JAVASCRIPT

### What I learned

I learned to practice my javascript and CSS.

- When we open a question the "internet" image will move.
- When we close the image will back to same place
- When we open a question we will activate the "active" component in CSS.
- When we open a new question the old question will close.
- Active in CSS will change police of question to be bold and will make answer
  appear.

### Continued development

Improve my javascript
